# Green-Time
A browser plugin to help people better use their time. It aims to use a gentle approach by not blocking the pages directly, but just warning the user before visiting the pages. So the user gives the final decision of leaving a page, so they are not faced with an external force.

## Getting Started

Open "about:debugging#/runtime/this-firefox" (for older firefox versions : "about:debugging") in Firefox, click "Load Temporary Add-on" and select any file in your extension's directory (See video [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cer9EUKegG4))
